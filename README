sdllife - by Jeremy Allen

Background
==
The algorithm used is from Michael Abrash' Graphics Programming Black Book. This project was primarily to prototype code that will ultimately be used on an Arduino 16x16 Matrix display. However, I enjoyed hacking on this and figured I would release a modern version of Abrash's algorithm. This is probably one of the speediest implementations you will find with no fancy data structures.

Requirements
==
You will need SDL >1.2.0, SDL_gfx, SDL_ttf. These are available on Ubuntu as standard packages. Both of these build under windows using MinGW and the makefile and code runs properly on both Linux and Windows. 

Usage
==
When the game is running the following commands can be issued via keypress or mouse click

r - Clear the current cells and create a new board
c - Clear the current cells
p - Pause the game
- - Speed the game up
+ - Slow the game down
q - Quit
