Tested on Ubuntu and MinGW


For Ubuntu install the following packages:

libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev

Installation command
--
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev


On MinGW the libraries are fairly well supported, but they must be properly installed into your MinGW installation.
